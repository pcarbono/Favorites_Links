# Favorites_Links
This application was developed during my classes as a Backend and Frontend developer. Nodejs, Mysql, Express and other Javascript technologies were used.

In essence, this application allows its users to store their favorite web links.

The application is a Nodejs CRUD. It involves a Login and Registration using Mysql, and protects the server routes. For styling, CSS, Bootstrap4, and Handlebars were used.
